\section{Usability test} \label{usabilitytest}
	
A usability test has been conducted to test the feasibility of the high fidelity prototype. Specifically, we want to know whether our dashboard solution has the potential to solve the issues surrounding the customization and integration of health software. This is merely a proof-of-concept, which demonstrates the solution at a very basic level. Health software is very complex and developing such a modular system for use in this sector is very resource intensive. Therefore, a usability test is absolutely necessary. The results of this test can indicate if further research on this topic is worthwhile. 

Customization and integration target two different groups. On one end, clinicians can customize their software environment to increase efficiency. On the other end, developers save time if new pieces of health software can be integrated through a simple process. As a result, two tests need to be designed, one targeting each group. The next sections describe the steps of the test procedure, the test setup, and the data gathering techniques for each topic.

    \subsection{Customization}

    
    To test the customization of the dashboard, qualitative data is gathered via interviews and observation. The actual functionality and appearance of the modules are not evaluated, only the customization aspect.


    \subsection{Integration}
