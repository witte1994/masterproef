    - problem:  - monolith MIS
                - no overview, long searching
                - what happened inbetween
		- each patient different needs
            -> fix:     - dashboard
                        - customize, end-user programming
                        - per patient
                        - default tags
    - aim & scope:  - what measure at home
                    - general practice
                    - proof of concept: limitations
                    - no HL7, only basic JSON
                    - no privacy
    - overview: - what is described when
                - MuiCSeR

2) background
-----
    - current MIS/EHR:  - description, advantages & disadvantages
                        - problems due to no customizability, finding info...
			- privacy
			- data standards
			- plugging in -> reduced health care cost
                -> why dashboard
    - e-health: - types of devices to measure parameters at home
                - send measured data to app/doctor
                - telemonitoring -> what happened between 2 consultations
    - effect customization on user performance/satisfaction (# clicks/pages)
    - data visualization

3) design
-----
    - research questions
    - scenarios & personas: versions
    - low fidelity: - mockups
                    - modules/features
                    - structure of pages
                    - versions
    - high fidelity:    - choice of frameworks/data format
                        - evolution
                        - difficulties
                        - changes compared to high fidelity

4) evaluation
-----
    - test: - structure
            - course
            - results
    - discussion: implications
    - conclusion
