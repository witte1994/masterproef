\section{Introduction}

The use of software solutions in health care has been more prevalent than ever before and has become an integral part of the daily workflow of clinicians. These solutions range from monolithic health information systems to the combined use of multiple standalone applications. Because of the rapid evolving nature of technology, health care institutions have to undergo frequent change. This requires clinicians to adapt to new software and devices. Time spent on providing optimal care therefore diminishes, while time spent on educating staff increases.
