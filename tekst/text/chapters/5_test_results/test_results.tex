\section{Usability test}
	
A usability test has been conducted to test the effectiveness of the high-fidelity prototype. The test involves users filling in questionnaires before and after using the prototype. The tester was required to follow a predefined list of steps while using the prototype. Only once the final step was completed, the test was finished. 

The following section will first describe in detail the setup of the whole usability test, such as the followed process, the documents (questionnaires, list of steps), the testing environment and information concerning the testers. Thereafter, the results of the test are shared and analyzed.
