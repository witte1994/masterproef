This thesis was the largest challenge I faced in my academic career. Throughout the entire process I expanded my knowledge in the health informatics domain greatly. The end result of this thesis would not have been possible without the support of the following people:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Professor Mieke Haesen and Jens Brulmans. Whenever I had questions or uncertainties, I could reach out to them for feedback and I am grateful for their guidance.
    \item The test participants that volunteered to participate in the usability test.
    \item My parents for their continued support through thick and thin.
    \item My close friends and roommates to provide me with the occasional rest and recreation.
\end{itemize}
