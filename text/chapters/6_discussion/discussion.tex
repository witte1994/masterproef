\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The search for participants began immediately after the usability test design was completed. This section describes the recruitment process. Hereafter the findings of the usability tests are noted.

    \subsection{Recruiting participants}

    Recruitment started on the 11th of December, 2018. A total of 13 people were contacted which have the following background:
    \vspace{-6pt}
    \begin{myitemize}
        \item 2 nursing students. All had internship experience in a hospital setting.
        \item 1 elderly care nurse.
        \item 2 intensive care unit nurses.
        \item 1 clinical laboratory department head.
        \item 1 paramedic.
        \item 2 home nurses, working for the same practice.
        \item 4 general practitioners, all work together under one practice.
    \end{myitemize}

    \noindent Five individuals immediately were scheduled to test the prototype. The two home nurses and one nursing student declined due to time constraints. The paramedic expressed interest but was unreachable for two weeks until the start of the new year. The practice with the four general practitioners were contacted three times via their shared secretary, twice via phone and one time in person. The secretary promised each time to provide an answer the next day via email, but was never heard from.

    As of writing, five participants have tested the prototype and one will test it the 5th of January. The other five tests were conducted between the 16th and 26th of December.

    \subsection{Findings}

    All conducted tests faced no issues regarding the application itself. Every participant tested the prototype in a secluded and silent environment. Three tests were conducted at the homes of the participants and the other two in empty classrooms of Hasselt University. The test was estimated to take approximately 40 minutes to complete. In anticipation of lengthy interviews, a hard stop was put in place in case the test passed the 60 minute mark. This was the case for two tests. When the test concluded, participants were rewarded with a bottle of white Sicilian wine with a price tag of \euro 4,29. During the recruitment phase, each contacted individual was aware of a reward, but they did not know what it was beforehand. % chktex 1

        \subsubsection{Results}

        \subsubsubsection{Pre-test questionnaire}

        Table~\ref{table:pre-test} shows some general information from the pre-test questionnaire regarding the participants. It should be noted that 4 out of 5 participants are between the age 21 and 25. They also indicate a higher familiarity with technology, compared to the older participant. The younger participants also have limited work experience. The pre-test questionnaire also indicated that all participants use their smartphone and lap-/desktop daily. Three participants use their tablet a few times every month. One participant uses a smartwatch daily, and is the only one to use a smartwatch at all.

        Table~\ref{table:pre-test-ehr} shows that all participants use a different EHR systems for their care setting and none of them are used on a mobile device. Three out of five participants gave their system positive scores regarding user satisfaction, its user friendliness, and the set of features it provides. One was neutral and the other slightly negative. Only two EHR systems provide customization. Lastly, one participant uses no less than 6 applications next to the EHR system, while another participant uses none.
