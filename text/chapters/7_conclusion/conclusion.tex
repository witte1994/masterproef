\section{Conclusion}

The literature study brought the following problems caused by EHR systems to light:
\begin{myitemize}
    \item An increase in the medical error rate after the installation of an EHR system, caused by poor usability and paper workarounds for missing functions.
    \item Heavy workflow disruption caused by the adoption or the update process of the system, resulting in productivity loss and negative motions.
\end{myitemize}

\noindent The design of the dashboard put a heavy focus on both usability and interoperability to solve these problems. The test indicated that the dashboard had good usability. This partly solves the first problem. The dashboard application was also easy to learn. As a result, clinicians adapt quickly to the new system, limiting a loss in productivity. Also, the good usability of the dashboard facilitates a positive user experience. It seems like the second problem is completely solved, which is not the case.

The usability test featured a simple version of the dashboard, not suitable for providing care. Therefore, the test won't affect the medical error rate, nor the workflow disruption, in any actual care setting. It is only during real use that these problems arise. However, clinical trails very complex studies in terms of organization.
