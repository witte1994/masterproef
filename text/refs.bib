abstract = {This paper explores the persona-scenario method by investigating how the method can support project participants in generating shared understandings and design ideas. As persona-scenarios are stories we draw on narrative theory to define what a persona-scenario is and which narrative elements it should consist of. Based on an empirical study a key finding is that despite our inherent human ability to construct, tell, and interpret stories it is not easy to write and present a good, coherent, and design-oriented story without methodical support. The paper therefore contributes with guidelines that delineate a) what a design-oriented persona-scenario should consist of (product) and b) how to write it (procedure) in order to generate and validate as many, new, and shared understandings and design ideas as possible (purpose). The purpose of the guidelines is to facilitate the construction of persona-scenarios as good, coherent stories, which make sense to the storytellers and to the audience – and which therefore generate many, new, and shared understandings and design ideas.},

abstract = {Healthcare organizations vary in the number of electronic medical record (EMR) systems they use. Some use a single EMR for nearly all care they provide, while others use EMRs from more than one vendor. These strategies create a mixture of advantages, risks and costs. Based on our experience in two organizations over a decade, we analyzed use of more than one EMR within our two health care organizations to identify advantages, risks and costs that use of more than one EMR presents. We identified the data and functionality types that pose the greatest challenge to patient safety and efficiency. We present a model to classify patterns of use of more than one EMR within a single healthcare organization, and identified the most important 28 data types and 4 areas of functionality that in our experience present special challenges and safety risks with use of more than one EMR within a single healthcare organization. The use of more than one EMR in a single organization may be the chosen approach for many reasons, but in our organizations the limitations of this approach have also become clear. Those who use and support EMRs realize that to safely and efficiently use more than one EMR, a considerable amount of IT work is necessary. Thorough understanding of the challenges in using more than one EMR is an important prerequisite to minimizing the risks of using more than one EMR to care for patients in a single healthcare organization.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper reviews the research literature on electronic health record (EHR) systems. The aim is to find out (1) how electronic health records are defined, (2) how the structure of these records is described, (3) in what contexts EHRs are used, (4) who has access to EHRs, (5) which data components of the EHRs are used and studied, (6) what is the purpose of research in this field, (7) what methods of data collection have been used in the studies reviewed and (8) what are the results of these studies. Methods: A systematic review was carried out of the research dealing with the content of EHRs. A literature search was conducted on four electronic databases: Pubmed/Medline, Cinalh, Eval and Cochrane. Results: The concept of EHR comprised a wide range of information systems, from files compiled in single departments to longitudinal collections of patient data. Only very few papers offered descriptions of the structure of EHRs or the terminologies used. EHRs were used in primary, secondary and tertiary care. Data were recorded in EHRs by different groups of health care professionals. Secretarial staff also recorded data from dictation or nurses' or physicians' manual notes. Some information was also recorded by patients themselves; this information is validated by physicians. It is important that the needs and requirements of different users are taken into account in the future development of information systems. Several data components were documented in EHRs: daily charting, medication administration, physical assessment, admission nursing note, nursing care plan, referral, present complaint (e.g. symptoms), past medical history, life style, physical examination, diagnoses, tests, procedures, treatment, medication, discharge, history, diaries, problems, findings and immunization. In the future it will be necessary to incorporate different kinds of standardized instruments, electronic interviews and nursing documentation systems in EHR systems. The aspects of information quality most often explored in the studies reviewed were the completeness and accuracy of different data components. It has been shown in several studies that the use of an information system was conducive to more complete and accurate documentation by health care professionals. The quality of information is particularly important in patient care, but EHRs also provide important information for secondary purposes, such as health policy planning. Conclusion: Studies focusing on the content of EHRs are needed, especially studies of nursing documentation or patient self-documentation. One future research area is to compare the documentation of different health care professionals with the core information about EHRs which has been determined in national health projects. The challenge for ongoing national health record projects around the world is to take into account all the different types of EHRs and the needs and requirements of different health care professionals and consumers in the development of EHRs. A further challenge is the use of international terminologies in order to achieve semantic interoperability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Effective design is crucial for dashboards. A good information design will clearly communicate key information to users and makes supporting information easily accessible. Dashboards and visualization are cognitive tools that improve your " span of control " over a lot of business data. These tools help people visually identify trends, pat-terns and anomalies, reason about what they see and help guide them toward effective decisions. As such, these tools need to leverage people's visual capabilities. With the prevalence of scorecards, dashboards and other visualization tools now widely available for business users to review their data, the issue of visual information design is more important than ever. Consider NASDAQ's unique situation. The exchange needed to communicate to the average investor what was happening in the stock market each and every day. However, as NASDAQ is a purely electronic stock exchange, there was no physical trading floor to take a television camera and no one to interview. The solution was ingenious: NASDAQ created MarketSite at Times Square in New York City, which provides a 6x20 video wall with real-time graphic displays on the current state of the market. The result: networks such as CNN and CNBC, now broadcast more than 150 stories each day from this location. Would NASDAQ have been as successful using stan-dard bar charts? NASDAQ's unique, clear graphics are critical for a broad audience to quickly assess the market information, thereby successfully communicating infor-mation to business professionals and consumers, and adds value to both the networks and NASDAQ's brand.},

The biomedical literature does not yet adequately describe the potential capabilities and utility of PHR systems. In addition, the lack of a proven business case for widespread deployment hinders PHR adoption. In a 2005 working symposium, the American Medical Informatics Association's College of Medical Informatics discussed the issues surrounding personal health record systems and developed recommendations for PHR-promoting activities. Personal health record systems are more than just static repositories for patient data; they combine data, knowledge, and software tools, which help patients to become active participants in their own care. When PHRs are integrated with electronic health record systems, they provide greater benefits than would stand-alone systems for consumers. This paper summarizes the College Symposium discussions on PHR systems and provides definitions, system characteristics, technical architectures, benefits, barriers to adoption, and strategies for increasing adoption.},

abstract = {Objective: Healthcare organizations are increasingly implementing electronic health records (EHRs) and other related health information technology (IT). Even in institutions which have long adopted these computerized systems, employees continue to rely on paper to complete their work. The objective of this study was to explore and understand human-technology integration factors that may be causing employees to rely on paper alternatives to the EHR. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 key-informants in a large Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), with a fully implemented EHR, to understand the use of paper-based alternatives. Participants included clinicians, administrators, and IT specialists across several service areas in the medical center. Results: We found 11 distinct categories of paper-based workarounds to the use of the EHR. Paper use related to the following: (1) efficiency; (2) knowledge/skill/ease of use; (3) memory; (4) sensorimotor preferences; (5) awareness; (6) task specificity; (7) task complexity; (8) data organization; (9) longitudinal data processes; (10) trust; and (11) security. We define each of these and provide examples that demonstrate how these categories promoted paper use in spite of a fully implemented EHR. Conclusions: In several cases, paper served as an important tool and assisted healthcare employees in their work. In other cases, paper use circumvented the intended EHR design, introduced potential gaps in documentation, and generated possible paths to medical error. We discuss implications of these findings for EHR design and implementation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether patterns of electronic health record (EHR) adoption and “meaningful use” vary between high-, intermediate-, and low-quality US hospitals. STUDY DESIGN We used data from the Hospital Quality Alliance program to designate hospitals as high quality (performance in the top decile nationally), low quality (bottom decile), and intermediate quality (all others). We examined EHR adoption and meaningful use using national survey data. METHODS We used logistic regression models to determine the frequency with which hospitals in each group adopted individual EHR functions and met meaningful use criteria, and factor analyses to examine adoption patterns in high- and low-quality hospitals. RESULTS High-quality hospitals were more likely to have all clinical decision support functions. High-quality hospitals were also more likely to have computerized physician order entry for medications compared with intermediate- and low-quality hospitals. Among those who had not yet implemented components of clinical decision support, two-thirds of low-quality hospitals reported no concrete plans for adoption. Finally, high-quality hospitals were more likely to meet many of the meaningful use criteria such as reporting quality measures, implementing at least 1 clinical decision support rule, and exchanging key clinical data. CONCLUSIONS We found higher rates of adoption of key EHR functions among high-quality hospitals, suggesting that high quality and EHR adoption may be linked. Most low-quality hospitals without EHR functions reported no plans to implement them, pointing to challenges faced by policy makers in achieving widespread EHR adoption while simultaneously improving quality of care.},

abstract = {This article presents an overview of a research project concerning the consultation of medical narratives in the electronic medical record (EMR). It describes an analysis of user needs, the design and implementation of a prototype EMR system, and the evaluation of the ease of consultation of medical narratives when using this system. In a questionnaire survey, 85 hospital physicians judged the quality of their paper-based medical record with respect to data entry, information retrieval and some other aspects. Participants were more positive about the paper medical record than the literature suggests. They wished to maintain the flexibility of data entry but indicated the need to improve the retrieval of information. A prototype EMR system was developed to facilitate the consultation of medical narratives. These parts were divided into labeled segments that could be arranged source-oriented and problem-oriented. This system was used to evaluate the ease of information retrieval of 24 internists and 12 residents at a teaching hospital when using free-text medical narratives divided at different levels of detail. They solved, without time pressure, some predefined problems concerning three voluminous, inpatient case records. The participants were randomly allocated to a sequence that was balanced by patient case and learning effect. The division of medical narratives affected speed, but not completeness of information retrieval. Progress notes divided into problem-related segments could be consulted 22{\%} faster than when undivided. Medical history and physical examination divided into segments at organ-system level could be consulted 13{\%} faster than when divided into separate questions and observations. These differences were statistically significant. The fastest divisions were also appreciated as the best combination of easy searching and best insight in the patient case. The results of our evaluation study suggest a trade-off between searching and reading: too much detailed segments will delay the consultation of medical narratives. Validation of the results in daily practice is recommended.},

In light of the changes anticipated from this policy initiative, the purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the literature on the benefits and drawbacks of EHR systems. Much of the literature has focused on key EHR functionalities, including clinical decision support systems, computerized order entry systems, and health information exchange. Our paper describes the potential benefits of EHRs that include clinical outcomes (eg, improved quality, reduced medical errors), organizational outcomes (eg, financial and operational benefits), and societal outcomes (eg, improved ability to conduct research, improved population health, reduced costs). Despite these benefits, studies in the literature highlight drawbacks associated with EHRs, which include the high upfront acquisition costs, ongoing maintenance costs, and disruptions to workflows that contribute to temporary losses in productivity that are the result of learning a new system. Moreover, EHRs are associated with potential perceived privacy concerns among patients, which are further addressed legislatively in the HITECH Act. Overall, experts and policymakers believe that significant benefits to patients and society can be realized when EHRs are widely adopted and used in a "meaningful" way.},

abstract = {Objective: To identify types of clinical unintended adverse consequences resulting from computerized provider order entry (CPOE) implementation. Design: An expert panel provided initial examples of adverse unintended consequences of CPOE. The authors, using qualitative methods, gathered and analyzed additional examples from five successful CPOE sites. Methods: Using a card sort method, the authors developed a categorization scheme for the 79 unintended consequences initially identified and then iteratively modified the scheme to categorize 245 additional adverse consequences resulting from fieldwork. Because the focus centered on consequences requiring prevention or remedial action, the authors did not further analyze reported unintended beneficial (positive) consequences. Results: Unintended adverse consequences (UACs) fell into nine major categories (in order of decreasing frequency): 1) more/new work for clinicians; 2) unfavorable workflow issues; 3) never ending system demands; 4) problems related to paper persistence; 5) untoward changes in communication patterns and practices; 6) negative emotions; 7) generation of new kinds of errors; 8) unexpected changes in the power structure; and 9) overdependence on the technology. Clinical decision support features introduced many of these unintended consequences. Conclusion: Identifying and understanding the types and in some instances the causes of unintended adverse consequences associated with CPOE will enable system developers and implementers to better manage implementation and maintenance of future CPOE projects. {\textcopyright} 2006 J Am Med Inform Assoc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the growing use of information technology (IT) in medical practices, little is known about the relationship between IT and physician satisfaction. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between physician IT adoption (of various applications) and overall practice satisfaction, as well as satisfaction with the level of computerization at the practice. METHODS: Data from a Florida survey examining physicians' use of IT and satisfaction were analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs), adjusted for physician demographics and practice characteristics, were computed utilizing logistic regressions to study the independent relationship of electronic health record (EHR) usage, PDA usage, use of e-mail with patients, and the use of disease management software with satisfaction. In addition, we examined the relationship between satisfaction with IT and overall satisfaction with the current medical practice. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, EHR users were 5 times more likely to be satisfied with the level of computerization in their practice (OR = 4.93, 95{\%} CI = 3.68-6.61) and 1.8 times more likely to be satisfied with their overall medical practice (OR = 1.77, 95{\%} CI = 1.35-2.32). PDA use was also associated with an increase in satisfaction with the level of computerization (OR = 1.23, 95{\%} CI = 1.02-1.47) and with the overall medical practice (OR = 1.30, 95{\%} CI = 1.07-1.57). E-mail use with patients was negatively related to satisfaction with the level of computerization in the practice (OR = 0.69, 95{\%} CI = 0.54-0.90). Last, physicians who were satisfied with IT were 4 times more likely to be satisfied with the current state of their medical practice (OR = 3.97, 95{\%} CI = 3.29-4.81). IMPLICATIONS: Physician users of IT applications, especially EHRs, are generally satisfied with these technologies. Potential adopters and/or policy makers interested in influencing IT adoption should consider the positive impact that computer automation can have on medical practice.},

abstract = {Objective  Despite existing knowledge regarding electronic health record (EHR) barriers in the ambulatory setting, little is known, specifically, about physicians who are likely to adopt EHR imminently. The current study identifies these imminent adopters and compares their barriers to other physicians.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n Design  and measurements Mail survey of Florida physicians (n=14 921) about barriers to EHR and adoption intentions. The survey asked respondents to classify themselves as planning to adopt an EHR system within one year (herein referred to as 'imminent adopters'), as planning to adopt an EHR systembut not within one year ('interested adopters'), and as not considering an EHR system. Chi-square analysis and logistic regression models were used to identify trends among imminent adopters and to compare barriers among respondents in each of the adoption categories above.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n Results  A total of 4203 returned surveys represented a 28.2{\%} response rate. Imminent adopters were significantly less likely to be in solo practice (19.6{\%} vs. 40.0{\%}, P{\textless}0.001) and more likely to be in an urban area (P=0.044) or in a multi-specialty practice (P=0.023). Imminent adopters were also more likely to be practising family medicine (P=0.014) or obstetrics/gyn{\_}cology (P=0.038). When comparedwith their colleagues, imminent adopters perceived EHR barriers very differently. For example, imminent adopters were significantly less likely to consider upfront cost of hardware/software [OR=0.35 (0.30, 0.45)] or that an inadequate return on investment [OR=0.25 (0.19, 0.34)] was a major barrier to EHR. Moreover, imminent adopters differed from their colleagues with respect to numerous other productivity-related and technical-related barriers.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n Conclusion  Policy and decision makers interested in promoting the adoption of EHR among physicians should focus on the needs and barriers of those most likely to adopt EHR. Given that imminent adopters differ considerably from their peers, current EHR incentive programmes that focus on financial barriers only might prove sub-optimal in achieving immediate widespread EHR adoption.},

This case discusses how a predictive evaluation method, Heuristic Walkthrough, was used to evaluate and improve the usability of the EHR system. Outcomes from the evaluation resulted in immediate changes in the system configuration and training materials, which helped to avoid usability problems at rollout, as well as change requests to the vendor to improve overall system usability in the long term.

This literature review suggests that the most promising applications for telemonitoring is for chronic illnesses such as cardiopulmonary disease, asthma, and heart failure in the home. Fetal heart rate monitoring and infant cardiopulmonary functions have also been monitored at a distance, as well as coagulation, or the level of activity of elderly people, assessed by the intelligent home monitoring devices. Hospitals, clinics, and prisons all have used telemonitoring, as have ambulances equipped with systems connected to the receiving hospital. Telemonitoring allows reduction of chronic disease complications thanks to a better followup; provides health care services without using hospital beds; and reduces patient travel, time off from work, and overall costs. Several systems have proven to be cost effective. Telemonitoring is also a way of responding to the new needs of home care in an ageing population. Real-time monitoring of patients in ambulances reduces the time to initiate treatment and allows the emergency crew to be better prepared. The obstacles to telemonitoring development include the initial costs of systems, physician licensing, and reimbursement. In the future, virtual reality, immersive environments, haptic feedback and nanotechnology promise new ways in improving the capabilities of telemonitoring.},

Rates of adoption are compared by selected physician and practice characteristics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) is based on a national probability sample of nonfederal office-based physicians who see patients in an office setting. Prior to 2008, data on physician characteristics were collected through in-person interviews with physicians. To increase the sample for analyzing physician adoption of EHR systems, starting in 2008, NAMCS physician interview data were supplemented with data from an EHR mail survey. This report presents estimates from the 2007 in-person interviews, combined 2008-2010 data from both the in-person interviews and the EHR mail surveys, and 2011-2012 data from the EHR mail surveys. Sample data were weighted to produce national estimates of office-based physician characteristics and their practices.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 2012, 71.8{\%} of office-based physicians reported using any type of EHR system, up from 34.8{\%} in 2007. In 2012, 39.6{\%} of physicians had an EHR system with features meeting the criteria of a basic system, up from 11.8{\%} in 2007; 23.5{\%} of office-based physicians had an EHR system with features meeting the criteria of a fully functional system in 2012, up from 3.8{\%} in 2007. In 2007, a wide gap existed in use of any type of EHR system between physicians in practices with 11 or more physicians (74.3{\%}) compared with physicians in smaller practices (20.6{\%} among solo practitioners); the gap, however, narrowed during 2007-2012. In 2007, no significant gap was observed in adoption of a fully functional system between primary care (4.7{\%}) and nonprimary care physicians (2.8{\%}); the gap, however, widened over time (27.9{\%} compared with 19.4{\%} in 2012). The difference in adoption of a fully functional system between physicians in practices with 11 or more physicians compared with solo practitioners was 10.4 percentage points in 2007; the gap widened to 30.6 percentage points in 2012.},

abstract = {f you want a single number, the answer is simple: test 5 users in a usability study. This lets you find almost as many usability problems as you'd find using many more test participants. This answer has been the same since I started promoting "discount usability engineering" in 1989. Doesn't matter whether you test websites, intranets, PC applications, or mobile apps. With 5 users, you almost always get close to user testing's maximum benefit-cost ratio. As with any human factors issue, however, there are exceptions: Quantitative studies (aiming at statistics, not insights): Test at least 20 users to get statistically significant numbers; tight confidence intervals require even more users. Card sorting: Test at least 15 users. Eyetracking: Test 39 users if you want stable heatmaps. However, these exceptions shouldn't worry you much: the vast majority of your user research should be qualitative — that is, aimed at collecting insights to drive your design, not numbers to impress people in PowerPoint. The main argument for small tests is simply return on investment: testing costs increase with each additional study participant, yet the number of findings quickly reaches the point of diminishing returns. There's little additional benefit to running more than 5 people through the same study; ROI drops like a stone with a bigger N . And if you have a big budget? Yea! Spend it on additional studies, not more users in each study. Sadly, most companies insist on running bigger tests. During the Usability Week conference, I surveyed 217 participants about the practices at their companies. The average response was that they used 11 test participants per round of user testing — more than twice the recommended size. Clearly, I need to better explain the benefits of small-N usability testing.},
