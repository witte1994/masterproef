abstract = {Purpose: This paper reviews the research literature on electronic health record (EHR) systems. The aim is to find out (1) how electronic health records are defined, (2) how the structure of these records is described, (3) in what contexts EHRs are used, (4) who has access to EHRs, (5) which data components of the EHRs are used and studied, (6) what is the purpose of research in this field, (7) what methods of data collection have been used in the studies reviewed and (8) what are the results of these studies. Methods: A systematic review was carried out of the research dealing with the content of EHRs. A literature search was conducted on four electronic databases: Pubmed/Medline, Cinalh, Eval and Cochrane. Results: The concept of EHR comprised a wide range of information systems, from files compiled in single departments to longitudinal collections of patient data. Only very few papers offered descriptions of the structure of EHRs or the terminologies used. EHRs were used in primary, secondary and tertiary care. Data were recorded in EHRs by different groups of health care professionals. Secretarial staff also recorded data from dictation or nurses' or physicians' manual notes. Some information was also recorded by patients themselves; this information is validated by physicians. It is important that the needs and requirements of different users are taken into account in the future development of information systems. Several data components were documented in EHRs: daily charting, medication administration, physical assessment, admission nursing note, nursing care plan, referral, present complaint (e.g. symptoms), past medical history, life style, physical examination, diagnoses, tests, procedures, treatment, medication, discharge, history, diaries, problems, findings and immunization. In the future it will be necessary to incorporate different kinds of standardized instruments, electronic interviews and nursing documentation systems in EHR systems. The aspects of information quality most often explored in the studies reviewed were the completeness and accuracy of different data components. It has been shown in several studies that the use of an information system was conducive to more complete and accurate documentation by health care professionals. The quality of information is particularly important in patient care, but EHRs also provide important information for secondary purposes, such as health policy planning. Conclusion: Studies focusing on the content of EHRs are needed, especially studies of nursing documentation or patient self-documentation. One future research area is to compare the documentation of different health care professionals with the core information about EHRs which has been determined in national health projects. The challenge for ongoing national health record projects around the world is to take into account all the different types of EHRs and the needs and requirements of different health care professionals and consumers in the development of EHRs. A further challenge is the use of international terminologies in order to achieve semantic interoperability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Effective design is crucial for dashboards. A good information design will clearly communicate key information to users and makes supporting information easily accessible. Dashboards and visualization are cognitive tools that improve your " span of control " over a lot of business data. These tools help people visually identify trends, pat-terns and anomalies, reason about what they see and help guide them toward effective decisions. As such, these tools need to leverage people's visual capabilities. With the prevalence of scorecards, dashboards and other visualization tools now widely available for business users to review their data, the issue of visual information design is more important than ever. Consider NASDAQ's unique situation. The exchange needed to communicate to the average investor what was happening in the stock market each and every day. However, as NASDAQ is a purely electronic stock exchange, there was no physical trading floor to take a television camera and no one to interview. The solution was ingenious: NASDAQ created MarketSite at Times Square in New York City, which provides a 6x20 video wall with real-time graphic displays on the current state of the market. The result: networks such as CNN and CNBC, now broadcast more than 150 stories each day from this location. Would NASDAQ have been as successful using stan-dard bar charts? NASDAQ's unique, clear graphics are critical for a broad audience to quickly assess the market information, thereby successfully communicating infor-mation to business professionals and consumers, and adds value to both the networks and NASDAQ's brand.},

The biomedical literature does not yet adequately describe the potential capabilities and utility of PHR systems. In addition, the lack of a proven business case for widespread deployment hinders PHR adoption. In a 2005 working symposium, the American Medical Informatics Association's College of Medical Informatics discussed the issues surrounding personal health record systems and developed recommendations for PHR-promoting activities. Personal health record systems are more than just static repositories for patient data; they combine data, knowledge, and software tools, which help patients to become active participants in their own care. When PHRs are integrated with electronic health record systems, they provide greater benefits than would stand-alone systems for consumers. This paper summarizes the College Symposium discussions on PHR systems and provides definitions, system characteristics, technical architectures, benefits, barriers to adoption, and strategies for increasing adoption.},

abstract = {Objective: Healthcare organizations are increasingly implementing electronic health records (EHRs) and other related health information technology (IT). Even in institutions which have long adopted these computerized systems, employees continue to rely on paper to complete their work. The objective of this study was to explore and understand human-technology integration factors that may be causing employees to rely on paper alternatives to the EHR. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 key-informants in a large Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), with a fully implemented EHR, to understand the use of paper-based alternatives. Participants included clinicians, administrators, and IT specialists across several service areas in the medical center. Results: We found 11 distinct categories of paper-based workarounds to the use of the EHR. Paper use related to the following: (1) efficiency; (2) knowledge/skill/ease of use; (3) memory; (4) sensorimotor preferences; (5) awareness; (6) task specificity; (7) task complexity; (8) data organization; (9) longitudinal data processes; (10) trust; and (11) security. We define each of these and provide examples that demonstrate how these categories promoted paper use in spite of a fully implemented EHR. Conclusions: In several cases, paper served as an important tool and assisted healthcare employees in their work. In other cases, paper use circumvented the intended EHR design, introduced potential gaps in documentation, and generated possible paths to medical error. We discuss implications of these findings for EHR design and implementation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether patterns of electronic health record (EHR) adoption and “meaningful use” vary between high-, intermediate-, and low-quality US hospitals. STUDY DESIGN We used data from the Hospital Quality Alliance program to designate hospitals as high quality (performance in the top decile nationally), low quality (bottom decile), and intermediate quality (all others). We examined EHR adoption and meaningful use using national survey data. METHODS We used logistic regression models to determine the frequency with which hospitals in each group adopted individual EHR functions and met meaningful use criteria, and factor analyses to examine adoption patterns in high- and low-quality hospitals. RESULTS High-quality hospitals were more likely to have all clinical decision support functions. High-quality hospitals were also more likely to have computerized physician order entry for medications compared with intermediate- and low-quality hospitals. Among those who had not yet implemented components of clinical decision support, two-thirds of low-quality hospitals reported no concrete plans for adoption. Finally, high-quality hospitals were more likely to meet many of the meaningful use criteria such as reporting quality measures, implementing at least 1 clinical decision support rule, and exchanging key clinical data. CONCLUSIONS We found higher rates of adoption of key EHR functions among high-quality hospitals, suggesting that high quality and EHR adoption may be linked. Most low-quality hospitals without EHR functions reported no plans to implement them, pointing to challenges faced by policy makers in achieving widespread EHR adoption while simultaneously improving quality of care.},

In a questionnaire survey, 85 hospital physicians judged the quality of their paper-based medical record with respect to data entry, information retrieval and some other aspects. Participants were more positive about the paper medical record than the literature suggests. They wished to maintain the flexibility of data entry but indicated the need to improve the retrieval of information. A prototype EMR system was developed to facilitate the consultation of medical narratives. These parts were divided into labeled segments that could be arranged source-oriented and problem-oriented. This system was used to evaluate the ease of information retrieval of 24 internists and 12 residents at a teaching hospital when using free-text medical narratives divided at different levels of detail. They solved, without time pressure, some predefined problems concerning three voluminous, inpatient case records. The participants were randomly allocated to a sequence that was balanced by patient case and learning effect. The division of medical narratives affected speed, but not completeness of information retrieval. Progress notes divided into problem-related segments could be consulted 22{\%} faster than when undivided. Medical history and physical examination divided into segments at organ-system level could be consulted 13{\%} faster than when divided into separate questions and observations. These differences were statistically significant. The fastest divisions were also appreciated as the best combination of easy searching and best insight in the patient case. The results of our evaluation study suggest a trade-off between searching and reading: too much detailed segments will delay the consultation of medical narratives. Validation of the results in daily practice is recommended.},
